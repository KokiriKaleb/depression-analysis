# Depression Analysis

### 1. Introduction
The primary objective of this analysis is to identify the key factors contributing to depression and gain insights into the relationships between variables in the dataset. By analyzing demographic information, academic or work-related stressors, and lifestyle habits, this study uncovers patterns and their potential influence on depression.

### 2. Data Preparation
#### **Handling Missing Values**:
  - Numerical columns were imputed using the mean, while categorical columns with missing values were replaced with the mode or a placeholder category ("Unknown").

#### **Feature Encoding**:
  - Categorical variables were encoded into numerical representations using label encoding, ensuring that numerically categorical variables retained their categorical meaning.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### **Univariate Analysis**:
- Histograms and boxplots revealed the distribution of numerical variables.
- Categorical variables were visualized using bar plots to highlight frequency distributions.

#### **Bivariate Analysis**:
- Correlations between numerical features and depression were visualized through heatmaps and bar charts.
- Scatterplots and pairplots helped identify relationships between numerical features.

#### **Key Findings**:
- **Work Pressure**, **Financial Stress**, and **Sleep Duration** showed notable relationships with depression.
- Categorical features like **Profession** and **Degree** revealed disparities in depression rates across groups.

### 4. Statistical Analysis
#### **Chi-Square Test**:
- Identified significant associations between depression and categorical features such as **Age**, **Profession**, and **Working Professional or Student** status.

#### **Mutual Information Scores**:
- Highlighted the dependency of depression on variables such as **Age** (highest score), **Work Pressure**, and **Profession**.
- Features like **Gender** and **Family History of Mental Illness** showed minimal association with depression.

#### **Key Insights from Statistical Analysis**:
1. **Highly Associated Features**:
   - **Age**, **Profession**, **Work Pressure**, and **Job Satisfaction** were strongly linked to depression.
2. **Moderately Associated Features**:
   - Features like **Financial Stress** and **Work/Study Hours** demonstrated moderate associations.
3. **Weakly Associated Features**:
   - Factors like **Sleep Duration** and **Gender** showed limited predictive power.

### 5. Key Findings and Observations
1. **Age and Depression**:
   - Younger age groups, particularly 18–25 and 26–35, exhibited higher depression rates due to factors like academic pressure and career instability.
   - Depression prevalence decreased with age, possibly due to better coping mechanisms and stable lifestyles.

2. **Work Pressure and Job Satisfaction**:
   - High work pressure and low job satisfaction were strongly associated with depression, emphasizing the need for workplace interventions.

3. **Sleep Duration**:
   - Shorter sleep durations (e.g., 4.5–5.5 hours) were associated with higher depression rates.
   - Optimal sleep durations (7.5–8.5 hours) were more common among non-depressed individuals.

4. **Unexpected Findings**:
   - Common assumptions about **Family History of Mental Illness** and **Sleep Duration** as strong predictors were not supported by this dataset.

### 6. Data Visualization
- **Heatmaps** revealed correlations between features and depression.
- **Bar Plots** ranked features based on their importance scores.
- **Violin Plots** and **Boxplots** showcased the variance in depression rates across categories.
- **Scatterplots** and **Pairplots** illustrated trends in numerical features.

### 7. Conclusion
This analysis identified key factors influencing depression and provided actionable insights:
1. Age-specific programs and workplace mental health interventions are essential.
2. Factors like **Work Pressure**, **Profession**, and **Job Satisfaction** should be prioritized in mental health strategies.
3. While **Gender** and **Family History of Mental Illness** are traditionally considered relevant, their roles appear limited in this dataset.

By leveraging these insights, targeted strategies can be developed to address mental health challenges more effectively.
