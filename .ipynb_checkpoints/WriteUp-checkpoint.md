Analysis of Depression Data
Depression Analysis
1. Introduction
The primary objective of this analysis is to identify key factors contributing to depression and gain insights into the relationships between variables in the dataset. The dataset includes various features, such as demographic information, academic or work-related stressors, and lifestyle habits. These features were analyzed to uncover patterns and their potential influence on depression.

2. Data Preperation
Handling Missing Values:

Numerical columns were imputed using the mean, and categorical columns with missing values were replaced with either the mode or a placeholder category ("Unknown").
Feature Encoding:

Categorical variables were encoded into numerical representations using label encoding as appropriate. Special attention was paid to numerically categorical variables, which were treated carefully to retain their categorical meaning.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis:

Histograms and boxplots were used to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
Categorical variables were visualized using bar plots, highlighting the frequency distribution of categories.
Bivariate Analysis:

Correlations between numerical features and the target variable (Depression) were calculated and visualized using a heatmap and bar charts.
Scatterplots and pairplots were used to identify relationships between numerical features.
Key Findings:

Features such as Work Pressure, Financial Stress, and Sleep Duration showed notable relationships with depression.
Categorical features like Profession and Degree highlighted disparities in depression rates across groups. 

Key Takeaways
* Gender: a 52% giving us a balanced dataset.
* Age: range from 18- 60 also giving us a blanced dataset of just adults. Though skewed slightly to older individuals.
* Working Professional/Student: skewed 80% towards Working Professionals. Students will be slightly underrepresented in this dataset.
* Depression: 17.8% of the population has been marked as having depression. The low percenate may require techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class-* weight adjustments if building predictive models.
* Suicidal Thoughts: Around 48.9% of the participants have had suicidal thoughts, significantly higher than the prevalence of depression. This suggests a potential overlap but not a direct 1:1 relationship between suicidal thoughts and depression.
* Family History of Mental Illness: Around 48.7% of participants reported a family history of mental illness, which could be a key risk factor in analysis.
* Work Pressure: Feature with high variablility.
* Sleep Duration: with the mean being 6.49 hours, indicating that the average participant sleeps less than the recommended 7â€“8 hours. A potential factor for poor mental health.
* Work/Study Hours: Wide range of values with a mean of 6.02 hours per day. Would need further analysis.
* Financial Stress: with a mean of 2.97 on a 5-point scale, indicating moderate financial stress on average.

Categorical features: Profession, Dietary Habits and Degree will be analyzed later in the notebook.

* Some stand out categorical features highligted Hyderbad as the City with the highest percentage of depression.
* Class 12 or being in your final year of highscool was almost 1:1 in depression and a stand out in the Depression by Degree category.
* There was a strong percentage of depression by both Work Pressure and Job Satisfaction in people who did not have values 'Unknown', and people who answered a 5 on a 1-5 scale.
* Depression by Profession showed 'Unknown' again as an almost 1:1 for depression, this could be interpreted as people who are unemployed or were not willing to answer this question. The second most depression by Profession was Graphic Designer but this data sample would be much to small to assume anything about the overall group.
* Depression by Dietary habits had Unhealthy leading in depression percentage, but not by a significant amount.
* The category Have You Ever had Suicidal Thoughts ? suprised me by the No's still having some depression and the Yes only having half depression. Which makes sense, as suicidal thoughts are a direct indicator or correlate to mental health issues like depression.
* For Gender I wanted to isolate this for analysis because I had heard of significant differences in suicide by men and women. While ther was a difference it was very small, while analizing the age groups it became more clear that age was much more of a significant factor for depression.

4. Statistical Analysis
Chi-Square Test:

The chi-square test was applied to categorical features to evaluate their association with depression.
Results showed significant relationships for features like Family History of Mental Illness and Gender.
Mutual Information:

Mutual information scores were computed for categorical features, revealing their dependency on the target variable.

5. Feature Selection
Chi-Square and Mutual Information:
Statistical tests ranked features based on their relevance to `Depression`
Machine Learning-Based Importance:
A Random Forest model was trained, and feature importance was derived, highlighting the most influential features.

7. Data Visualization
Several visualizations were employed throughout the notebook to illustrate the findings:
* Heatmaps highlighted correlations between features.
* Bar plots ranked features based on importance scores.
* Violin plots and boxplots showcased variance in depression rates across categories.
* Scatterplots revealed trends in numerical features.

8. Conclusion
This analysis has identified key factors contributing to depression and offered actionable insights. The combination of statistical methods and machine learning techniques ensured a thorough examination of the data. By focusing on the highlighted features, policymakers, employers, and educators can design targeted strategies to address the factors contributing to mental health challenges.
