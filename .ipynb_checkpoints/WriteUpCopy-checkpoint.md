Analysis of Depression Data
1. Introduction
The primary objective of this analysis is to identify key factors contributing to depression and gain insights into the relationships between variables in the dataset. The dataset includes various features, such as demographic information, academic or work-related stressors, and lifestyle habits. These features were analyzed to uncover patterns and their potential influence on depression.

2. Data Preparation
Handling Missing Values:
Numerical columns were initially imputed using the mean but ultimately I decided to replace categorical columns with missing values a placeholder category ("Unknown").
Feature Encoding:
Categorical variables were encoded into numerical values as appropriate.
Special attention was paid to numerically categorical variables, which were treated carefully to retain their categorical meaning.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis:
Histograms and boxplots were used to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
Categorical variables were visualized using bar plots, highlighting the frequency distribution of categories.

Bivariate Analysis:
Correlations between numerical features and the target variable (Depression) were calculated and visualized using a heatmap and bar charts.
Scatterplots and pairplots were used to identify relationships between numerical features.

Key Findings:
Features such as Working or Student, negative correlation with age ie. younger people had more depression, and Suicidal Thoughts showed notable positive relationships with depression.
For the categorical analysis I wanted to visualize the percentage of depression in each variable. I then ordered them from the by depression percentage. 
* Some stand out categorical features highligted Hyderbad as the City with the highest percentage of depression.
* Class 12 or being in your final year of highscool was almost 1:1 in depression and a stand out in the Depression by Degree category.
* There was a strong percentage of depression by both Work Pressure and Job Satisfaction in people who did not have values 'Unknown', and people who answered a 5 on a 1-5 scale.
* Depression by Profession showed 'Unknown' again as an almost 1:1 for depression, this could be interpreted as people who are unemployed or were not willing to answer this question. The second most depression by Profession was Graphic Designer but this data sample would be much to small to assume anything about the overall group.
* Depression by Dietary habits had Unhealthy leading in depression percentage, but not by a significant amount.
* The category Have You Ever had Suicidal Thoughts ? suprised me by the No's still having some depression and the Yes only having half depression. Which makes sense, as suicidal thoughts are a direct indicator or correlate to mental health issues like depression.
* For Gender I wanted to isolate this for analysis because I had heard of significant differences in suicide by men and women. While ther was a difference it was very small, while analizing the age groups it became more clear that age was much more of a significant factor for depression.

5. Statistical Analysis and Feature Selection
Chi-Square Test:
The chi-square test was applied to categorical features to evaluate their association with depression.
Results showed significant relationships for features like Age, Work/Study Hours, Suicidal Thoughts and whether they were a student or not.\

Mutual Information:
Mutual information scores were computed for the most sigificant features, revealing their dependency on the target variable.

6. Data Visualization
Several visualizations were employed throughout the notebook to illustrate the findings:
* Heatmaps highlighted correlations between features.
* Bar plots ranked features based on importance scores.
* Violin plots and boxplots showcased variance in depression rates across categories.
* Scatterplots revealed trends in numerical features.
  
7. Recommendations and Next Steps
Interventions:
Focus interventions on highly correlated features such as Age and Students.
Promote healthy habits like regular breaks from work/studying to mitigate risk factors for depression. 
Further Analysis:
Incorporate additional data (e.g., social or environmental factors) to strengthen the model.
Use predictive modeling to develop a robust tool for depression risk assessment.
8. Conclusion
This analysis has identified key factors contributing to depression and offered actionable insights. The statistical methods ensured a thorough examination of the data. By focusing on the highlighted features, policymakers, employers, and educators can design targeted strategies to address the factors contributing to mental health challenges.
